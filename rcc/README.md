# Hinge Forest RCC segmentation in MRI
This is my messy code for Hinge Forest applied to kidney, cyst, and RCC tumor segmentation in MRI. I will document it more in the near future.

# 2D U-Net Comparison
An older version of U-Net comparison code can be found [here](https://github.com/nslay/VHLRCC). Sorry it's also messy and not documented yet! I will be updating both repositories soon!

# Data
As much as I'd like to share the data set with you, it is extremely difficult to make it public!

# MONAI
I have been learning MONAI recently and I hope to commit a cleaner MONAI-based reproducion in the near future.
